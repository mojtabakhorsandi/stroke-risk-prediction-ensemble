This project uses a stroke-risk dataset (~5110 samples, 12 features) originally available on Kaggle.
The dataset contains demographic and medical features such as age, hypertension, heart disease,
average glucose level, BMI, and smoking status, with the target label (stroke = 1, no stroke = 0).

Due to ethical and privacy considerations, the raw dataset is not shared in this repository.
However, all steps for preprocessing, handling imbalanced data, dimensionality reduction,
hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation are provided in the notebook.
